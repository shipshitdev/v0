**Local modifications:** removed the hard dependency on the parent `/impeccable` orchestrator skill (not part of this marketplace) and inlined a self-contained Context Gathering summary plus the AI-slop DON'T list, so the skill runs standalone.

**Checking for upstream changes:** when *Upstream latest* is ahead of *Forked at*, diff [`skill/reference/audit.md`](https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable/blob/main/skill/reference/audit.md) against tag `skill-v2.1.1`, port anything worth bringing home, then bump `metadata.upstream_version` and `metadata.last_synced` in `SKILL.md` and this table.
